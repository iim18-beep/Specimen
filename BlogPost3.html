<p id="Paragraph9">A better representation of the Plaza font can be seen in classic cartoons like Batman: the Animated Series. The font meshes very well with Batman: TAS's art deco/noir based aesthetic, which very much mimics the architecture and vehicle designs of the 1920s-30s. The combinaion of Alan Meeks's Plaza typeface and the art deco inspired designs of the animated Batman show helped create a unique identity for not just the show itself but the entire world of Batman. Gotham had effectively become a character with its own individual personality and visual identity, and the font very much complements the look.</p>
